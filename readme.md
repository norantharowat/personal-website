The following figure demonstrates the spreading and settling of the particles from a cough cloud emitted horizontally. This cloud is of radius r(t) at position s(t) from the source, where **r = alpha * S**, while alpha is a constant known as the entrainment coefficient. and **S = t^ 1/4**

alpha  was taken too be 0.03
